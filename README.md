# 🎭 Mad Libs Game – Java Console Application

A simple and interactive **Mad Libs game** built using **Java**. This console-based application prompts the user for different words (adjectives, nouns, verbs) and dynamically generates a fun story based on the input.

This project is ideal for beginners learning **Java fundamentals**, especially handling user input and working with strings.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Mad Libs Game is a classic word game where players provide random words that are inserted into a predefined story template. The result is often humorous and unpredictable.

This Java implementation runs entirely in the **command line** and demonstrates core programming concepts in a clean and readable way.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive command-line gameplay  
- Takes user input using the `Scanner` class  
- Generates a dynamic story based on input  
- Simple, beginner-friendly Java code  
- Easy to modify and extend  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- `java.util.Scanner`
- Command Line / Terminal

## 🎮 How the Game Works

The program asks the user to input:
- An adjective  
- A noun (animal or person)  
- Another adjective  
- A verb ending in **-ing**  
- A final adjective  

Using these inputs, the program constructs a short story like:

```
Today I went to a funny zoo.
In an exhibit, I saw a monkey.
Monkey was energetic and jumping!
I was amazed!
```

Each run produces a different story depending on the user’s input.

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

- Java program structure (`main` method, classes)
- Variables and data types
- User input using `Scanner`
- String concatenation
- Console input/output
- Resource management (`scanner.close()`)

---

## 🚀 Possible Enhancements

- Add multiple story templates  
- Randomize story selection  
- Validate user input  
- Convert to a GUI using JavaFX or Swing  
- Add file-based input/output
